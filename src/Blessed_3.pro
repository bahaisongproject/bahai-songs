Blessed is the sp[C]ot, and the house, and the place, and the city,

and the h[Am]eart, and the mountain, and the refuge, and the c[Fmaj7]ave,

and the valley, and the land, and the sea, and the [G]island,

and the m[C]eadow where mention of God hath been m[Am]ade and

His praise glorif[Fmaj7]ied, glorified, [G]   glorif[C]ied.
