## Getting Started

- Install `chordpro`: https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/ChordPro-Installation.html
- Install `pdftk` version 2.0.2: https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-version-history/ (only needed for adding the bahá'í song project logo -- you can also skip this and remove the the command in the Makefile)

Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:daysm/bahai-songs.git`

Add a new .pro file in src/ and run `make` at the repository root to create PDF files for all new/changed .pro files.
