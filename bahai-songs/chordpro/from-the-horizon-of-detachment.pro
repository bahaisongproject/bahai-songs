From the hor[G]izon of detachment Thou hast m[D]anifested souls 
that, [Am7]even as the shining m[C]oon, shed radiance 
up[G]on the realm of heart and s[D]oul
rid thems[Am7]elves from the attrib[C]utes 
of the w[G]orld of ex[D]istence and hastened f[Am7]orth unto the kingdom [C]of 
immortalit[G]y, of immortalit[D]y, of immortalit[Am7]y, of immortalit[C]y.
