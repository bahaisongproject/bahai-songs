O Lord! I am weak, strengthen me
with Thy power and potency. 

My tongue falters
        My tongue falters

suffer me to utter
        suffer me to utter

thy commemoration and praise

I am lowly
        I am lowly

honour me
        honour me

through admitting
        through admitting

me into Thy kingdom
        me into Thy kingdom

O Lord! I am weak, strengthen me
        with Thy power and potency.
