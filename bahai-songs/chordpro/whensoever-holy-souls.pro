||: Wh[C]ensoever holy souls, drawing on the powers of h[Em]eaven,
shall ar[C]ise with such qualities of the sp[Em]irit, of the spirit :||
||: [C]     march in unison, rank on rank, every one of those souls
will be even as [Em]     one thousand, one thousand, :||
||: and the s[C]urging waves of that mighty ocean will be even as
the battalions of the C[Em]oncourse on high, of the Concourse on high. :||
